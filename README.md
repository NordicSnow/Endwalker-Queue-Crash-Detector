# Endwalker-Queue-Crash-Detector
a python script that maybe can detect when you 2002 out of the login queue and notify you via telegram

Input a telegram bot token, telegram user ID, and the file path to your FFXIV.cfg file (usually in your my games folder somewhere). Truth be told i'm just taking someone's word on reddit that this is a viable way to detect if you get logged out so if it doesn't work, sorry.
